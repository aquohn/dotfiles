# `dotfiles`

This is my personal dotfiles setup, meant to be portable across a wide variety of distributions, with a variety of available software. Where possible,
* The existence of commands is tested using `command -v` before they are invoked/configured
* Configuration is done in POSIX-compliant `sh`
* Paths are constructed using environment variables
